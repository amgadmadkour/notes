# Dimensionality Reduction

- Working with high-dimensional data is difficult as it becomes harder to analyze and visualize data.
- High-dimensional data is often over-complete, meaning that there are dimensions that are redundant and can be explained by other dimensions.
- Dimensionality reduction allows us to work with a more compact representation of the data while preserving most of the information.
