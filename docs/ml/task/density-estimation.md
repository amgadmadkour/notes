# Density Estimation

- Density estimation is the process of representing data in a compact form using a density from a parametric family such as a Gaussian or beta distribution.
- It involves determining an unknown function given only random samples or observations.
- Density estimation is used to find the density of a population by examining a random sample of data from that population.
