# Types of Learning

There are several ways to categorize machine learning algorithms. One way is to categorize them by the type of learning they use. The following is a list of the types of learning:

1. Trained using human **supervision**.
      1. [Supervised Learning](type/supervised-learning.md): The training data is labeled.
      2. [Unsupervised Learning](type/unsupervised-learning.md): The training data is unlabeled.
      3. [Semi-supervised Learning](type/semi-supervised-learning.md): The training data is partially labeled.
      4. [Reinforcement Learning](type/reinforcement-learning.md): The training data is the result of an agent interacting with an environment.
2. Learn by **detecting patterns**.
      1. [Instance-based Learning](type/instance-based-learning.md): The system learns the training data and uses a similarity measure to generalize to new instances.
      2. [Model-based Learning](type/model-based-learning.md): The system learns a model of the training data and uses the model to generalize to new instances.
3. Learn **incrementally** or **on the fly**.
      1. [Online Learning](type/online-learning.md): The system learns incrementally from a stream of data.
      2. [Batch Learning](type/batch-learning.md): The system learns from a fixed dataset.
