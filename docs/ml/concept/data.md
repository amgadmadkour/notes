# Data

- Data is the core of machine learning where general-purpose methodologies are designed to **extract valuable patterns** from data.
- For example, given a large corpus of documents, machine learning methods are used to automatically extract topics from the documents.
- Data is usually presented in the form of a **numeric vector**.
- Data is presented **typically in tabular format** where each **row** is an **instance** and each **column** is a [feature](feature.md).
