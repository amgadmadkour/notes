# Data

- Data is the core of machine learning where general-purpose methodologies are designed to **extract valuable patterns** from data.
- For example, given a large corpus of documents, machine learning methods are used to automatically extract topics from the documents.
- Data is usually presented in the form of a numeric vector.
- Data is typically presented in a tabular format where each row is an instance and each column is a feature.
