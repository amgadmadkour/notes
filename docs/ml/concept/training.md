# Training

Training is the process of teaching a machine learning model to recognize patterns in data. Training data is used to train the model to learn these patterns. 

## Example

Suppose we have a dataset for house prices given its square footage as follows:

| Square Footage (x) | Price (y) |
|---------------------|-----------|
| 1,000               | 300,000   |
| 2,000               | 500,000   |
| 3,000               | 700,000   |

### Notation:
- ***x***: input features
- ***y***: output targets
- ***m***: number of instances
- ***(x, y)***: instance
- ***(x<sup>i</sup>, y<sup>i</sup>)***: Single training i-th instance
