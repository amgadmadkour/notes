# Instance-based learning

## Overview

Instance-based learning (also known as **memory-based or lazy learning**) involves learning from training examples and generalizing to new instances based on similarity measures12.

## Pros

- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to new data without retraining.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.

## Cons

- **Time Complexity**: High time complexity, especially with large datasets.
- **Storage Requirements**: Requires storing all training data.

## Examples

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
- Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)
