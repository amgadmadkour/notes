# Supervised Learning

- In order to train a machine learning model, we need to provide it with ***training data***.
- The training data consists of a set of instances. Each instance is a pair of an input and an output. The input is a set of ***features*** and the output is a ***label***.
- The goal of supervised learning is to learn a ***function*** that maps the ***input*** to the ***output***.

!!! info
    The term *feature* is used interchangeably with the term *attribute*. An attribute usually denotes a property name only while a feature denotes a property name and value.
